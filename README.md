# Webscraping-Yelp website
I webscraped the user comments of the top 10 indian cuisine restaurant in New york city on yelp using selenium, definitions, few number of loops with time sleep function for better web scrapping.
This was an advanced python homework given to us by my University professor.

Future work: Work on the sentimental analysis score.
